# Population Genetics using R

The `R` programming language has many libraries of great use, and increasingly so for both population genetic analysis and for learning and teaching population genetics.

So here is a brief list.

## lists of lists
As always [CRAN Task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) is a good place to start for an overall view of libraries that are useful. In particular the Task view for [Genetics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Genetics.html) and for [phylogenetics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Phylogenetics.html). There are particular areas of overlap in these disciplines (i.e. simulating genealogies) which can be quite important.

Nescent also maintains a [list](http://popgen.nescent.org/PACKAGES.html)

## Special issue with R packages
There was also a nice special issue in the journal *Molecular Ecology Resources* on **Population Genomics with R**. The issue is [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/men.2017.17.issue-1/issuetoc). This has numerous papers describing a number of software tools in R. This [introduction](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1755-0998.12636/full) summarizes lots of it if you want to take a look.
